# MazePathfinder
Project 3 for data strurctures class, one of the ways I solved it, recursively searching a maze and finding the shortest paths that finds the most food
I added an updated solution, MazeSolver.h and MazeSolver.cpp, thanks to @AnonDrew who turned my original recursive solution into a class making it
scalable
There was additional files from the class, Maze.h, Maze.cpp, MazeCell.h, and MazeCell.cpp, that determined the functionality of the maze however I deleted them because they were copywritten by the professor and I did not recieve permission to post them
